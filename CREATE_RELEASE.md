# How to Create Release v1.0.2

Since Git is not available in this environment, you'll need to create the release from GitHub. Here are the exact steps:

## Method 1: Manual Workflow Trigger (Recommended)

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the **Actions** tab
3. Find the **"Create Release"** workflow in the left sidebar
4. Click on **"Create Release"**
5. Click the **"Run workflow"** button (top right)
6. In the dropdown:
   - Leave branch as `main` (or your default branch)
   - Enter `1.0.2` in the version field
   - Keep "Create new tag" checked
7. Click **"Run workflow"**

The workflow will automatically:
- Create the v1.0.2 tag
- Build executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux with fixed PyInstaller configuration
- Generate SHA256 checksums
- Create source archives
- Publish everything as a GitHub release

## What's Fixed in v1.0.2

- ✅ **Fixed "No module named 'textual.widgets.tab_pane'" error**
- ✅ **Added comprehensive hidden imports for all Textual modules**
- ✅ **Enhanced build process with --collect-all=textual flag**
- ✅ **Improved build reliability across all platforms**

## Method 2: Create Release Directly

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **"Releases"** in the right sidebar
3. Click **"Create a new release"**
4. Set tag version: `v1.0.2`
5. Set release title: `Meet-Zone v1.0.2`
6. Add release description (see workflow for template)
7. Check **"Set as the latest release"**
8. Click **"Publish release"**

This will trigger the build workflow automatically.

## Method 3: From Local Machine (if you have the code locally)

```bash
# Clone or update your local repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meet-zone.git
cd meet-zone

# Make sure you have the latest changes
git pull origin main

# Create and push the tag
git tag v1.0.2
git push origin v1.0.2
```

## What Happens Next

Once triggered, the GitHub Actions workflow will:

1. **Build Windows executable** with fixed PyInstaller config
2. **Build macOS executable** with all Textual modules included
3. **Build Linux executable** with comprehensive hidden imports
4. **Create source archives** (`.zip` and `.tar.gz`)
5. **Generate SHA256 checksums** for all files
6. **Create GitHub release** with all assets attached

## Expected Release Assets

Your v1.0.2 release will include:
- `meet-zone-windows-1.0.2.exe` + checksum (FIXED - no more import errors!)
- `meet-zone-macos-1.0.2` + checksum  
- `meet-zone-linux-1.0.2` + checksum
- `meet-zone-source-1.0.2.zip` + checksum
- `meet-zone-source-1.0.2.tar.gz` + checksum

## Key Improvements

The new PyInstaller configuration includes:
- `--hidden-import=textual.widgets.tab_pane` (the missing module)
- All Textual widgets, containers, and core modules
- `--collect-all=textual` for complete framework inclusion
- Enhanced reliability across all platforms

## Troubleshooting

If the workflow fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error details
2. Ensure all required files are present in the repository
3. Verify the workflow file syntax in `.github/workflows/release.yml`
4. Make sure the repository has the necessary permissions for releases

The build process typically takes 5-10 minutes to complete across all platforms.

## Testing the Fix

Once the release is created, download the appropriate executable and test:

```bash
# Windows
meet-zone-windows-1.0.2.exe

# macOS (make executable first)
chmod +x meet-zone-macos-1.0.2
./meet-zone-macos-1.0.2

# Linux (make executable first)
chmod +x meet-zone-linux-1.0.2
./meet-zone-linux-1.0.2
```

The "No module named 'textual.widgets.tab_pane'" error should be completely resolved!
