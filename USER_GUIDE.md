Alice,America/New_York,09:00,17:00,12:00-13:00:Lunch

# Weekly recurring (every Monday)
Bob,Europe/London,08:30,16:30,10:00-11:00@Mon:Team standup

# Specific date
Charlie,Asia/Tokyo,10:00,18:00,14:00-15:00@2024-01-15:Doctor appointment

# Multiple busy times (separated by semicolons)
Diana,Australia/Sydney,08:00,16:00,12:00-13:00:Lunch;10:00-11:00@Mon:Standup;15:00-16:00@Fri:Review

# Day names supported
Eva,Europe/Berlin,09:30,17:30,09:00-10:00@Monday:All-hands;14:00-15:00@Wed:Client call
```

### Managing Busy Schedules

- **View All**: The busy schedule table shows all participants' busy times
- **Remove Selected**: Click on a busy schedule entry and click "Remove Selected"
- **Clear All Busy**: Remove all busy schedules for all participants

## Finding Meeting Times

### Basic Configuration

1. Go to the **Meeting Times** tab
2. Configure your search parameters:
   - **Min Duration**: Minimum meeting length in minutes (default: 30)
   - **Top Results**: How many options to show (default: 3)
   - **Show Full Week**: Search entire week vs. just today
   - **Prioritize By**: Focus on maximizing participants or meeting duration
   - **Start Date**: When to begin the search (default: today)

3. Click **Find Meeting Times**

### How Busy Schedules Affect Results

The algorithm now considers busy schedules when finding meeting times:

1. **Availability Check**: Ensures participants are within working hours
2. **Busy Schedule Filter**: Excludes participants who are busy during potential meeting times
3. **Optimal Matching**: Finds times when the maximum number of people are both available and not busy
4. **Smart Scoring**: Prefers times with fewer conflicts and better participation

### Advanced Options

#### Prioritization Strategies

- **Participants**: Prioritizes slots with more people available (considers busy schedules)
- **Duration**: Prioritizes longer available time slots (avoiding busy periods)

#### Time Range Options

- **Today Only**: Find slots for today only
- **Full Week**: Search across the next 7 days for more options (better for global teams)

## Understanding Results

### Result Columns

- **Start (UTC)**: Meeting start time in UTC
- **End (UTC)**: Meeting end time in UTC  
- **Duration**: How long the meeting slot is
- **Count**: Number of participants available (excludes those who are busy)
- **Score**: Quality score as a percentage (higher is better)
- **Names**: List of available participants (busy participants are automatically excluded)

### Interpreting Scores with Busy Schedules

The enhanced scoring system considers:
- **Participant availability**: More people available = higher score
- **Busy schedule conflicts**: Fewer conflicts = higher score
- **Meeting duration**: Longer slots = higher score (up to a point)
- **Time of day preference**: Business hours (9 AM - 5 PM UTC) = higher score
- **Day preference**: Earlier days in the week = slightly higher score

A score of 80%+ indicates an excellent meeting slot with minimal conflicts.

## Tips and Best Practices

### Setting Up Busy Schedules

1. **Start with regular patterns**: Add daily lunch breaks and weekly meetings first
2. **Be consistent**: Use the same time format and descriptions
3. **Plan ahead**: Add known conflicts like vacations or important appointments
4. **Use descriptions**: Help identify what the busy time is for
5. **Regular updates**: Keep busy schedules current for best results

### Getting Better Results

1. **Add comprehensive busy schedules**: More accurate data = better meeting times
2. **Use realistic working hours**: Don't extend hours beyond what's practical
3. **Consider time zones carefully**: Double-check timezone selections
4. **Try different prioritization**: Switch between "participants" and "duration" modes
5. **Use full week search**: Gives more flexibility, especially with busy schedules

### Working with Global Teams

1. **Account for local busy times**: Lunch breaks vary by culture and timezone
2. **Consider recurring meetings**: Set up weekly team meetings as busy times
3. **Plan for holidays**: Add country-specific holidays as busy dates
4. **Rotate meeting times**: Fair for all time zones over time
5. **Use specific dates for conflicts**: Vacations, conferences, etc.

### CSV File Tips

1. **Test busy schedule format**: Start with simple examples
2. **Use semicolons for multiple slots**: `10:00-11:00@Mon:Standup;14:00-15:00:Review`
3. **Be specific with dates**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format
4. **Consistent descriptions**: Help identify recurring patterns
5. **Validate before importing**: Check format with small test files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No slots found" (with busy schedules)
- **Cause**: Too many busy schedule conflicts
- **Solutions**: 
  - Review busy schedules for accuracy
  - Try longer time range (full week)
  - Reduce minimum duration
  - Check if working hours overlap after busy times are excluded

#### Busy schedule not working
- **Check format**: Ensure proper time format (HH:MM-HH:MM)
- **Verify dates**: Use YYYY-MM-DD for specific dates
- **Day names**: Use Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun
- **Semicolon separation**: Multiple busy times need semicolons

#### Incorrect busy time exclusions
- **Time zone issues**: Busy times are in participant's local timezone
- **Date boundaries**: Check if busy times cross midnight
- **Recurring logic**: Weekly recurring uses day of week, not specific dates

#### CSV import with busy schedules fails
- **Check columns**: Must have exactly 5 columns including busy_schedule
- **Format validation**: Test busy schedule format separately
- **Encoding issues**: Save CSV as UTF-8
- **Empty busy schedules**: Use empty string, not spaces

### Performance with Busy Schedules

- **Complex schedules**: Many busy slots may slow calculations
- **Full week searches**: Take longer with busy schedule checking
- **Large teams**: 20+ participants with busy schedules need more processing time

### Getting Help

1. **Check debug logs**: `meet-zone-debug.log` contains detailed information
2. **Test busy schedule format**: Use the UI to validate before CSV import
3. **Run from command line**: Shows real-time error messages
4. **Open an issue**: Report bugs on GitHub with:
   - Your operating system
   - Sample CSV with busy schedules (anonymized)
   - Contents of debug log
   - Steps to reproduce the problem

## Command Line Usage

Meet-Zone supports command-line usage with busy schedule-enabled CSV files:

```bash
# Basic usage with CSV file (including busy schedules)
./meet-zone roster.csv

# Find longer meetings (useful when many people have busy schedules)
./meet-zone roster.csv --duration 60

# Search full week (better results with busy schedules)
./meet-zone roster.csv --week

# Prioritize by participants (good when busy schedules limit availability)
./meet-zone roster.csv --prioritize participants

# Combine options for complex scheduling
./meet-zone roster.csv --duration 45 --top 10 --week --prioritize participants
```
